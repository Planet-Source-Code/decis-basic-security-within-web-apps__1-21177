## Basic Security Within Web Apps


</div>

### Description

This code is a simple demonstration of how to apply security to your web class projects. I am quite new to webclasses and a book I was reading seemed to make this more difficult than need be.

Hope its of use to somebody. To run you must have personal web server installed. Its not brilliant, I know, but maybe it can get you started in the right direction took me about 15 mins to do.
 
### More Info
 
Ensure Personal Web server is installed or it wont work.

Validates a logon against an access 2000 database, if your running 97, its easily changed
